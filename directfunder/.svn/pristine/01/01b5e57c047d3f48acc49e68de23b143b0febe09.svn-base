			<p class="txt-30 txt-gray pl-5">BUSINESS LOANS!</p>
			<p class="txt-17 txt-gray txt-justify sec1 pl-5">
				Business loans are an important part of a business’s survival and ultimate success. Money and capital are essential in allowing companies to grow and in taking advantage of strategic investments.  Business loans are the most common way for a business to obtain funding.   A key source for business loans that most businesses take advantage of are the business owner’s personal savings. With a personal savings business loan there is no one to repay, therefore issues such as interest and monthly payments become moot because the business owner is issuing the business loan his or herself.
			</p>

		</div>
		<p class="txt-17 txt-gray txt-justify sec1 pl-5">However the obvious risk of this type of business loan is that if the business does fail, the business owner’s own money is subject to risk and loss.   Business Loan Org and Direct Funder bring you vital information on the financial management of your business. There are a broad number of ways to acquiring the necessary funding, including the United States Small Business Administration (SBA). They provide numerous programs to help businesses in various situations with various types of business loans.</p>
		<p class="txt-17 txt-gray txt-justify bold sec1 pl-5">
			While money is a large part of keeping a business intact, there are many other important aspects such as knowledge, experience, and organization. Keeping business plan and following a schedule can be the difference between failure and success. When forecasting your business’s capital needs, always overestimate how much you will need and why a business loan is the best way to achieve your business’s goals. The cost of borrowing money can be very high without proper planning. Some things to think about include:

	<div class="container viewport" >
		<div class="feature  pr-5">
			<ul>
				<li>How badly does your business need the money? Will it be to startup or expand your business? Or is it just to ensure the business runs smoothly?</li>
				<li>Is your business in great risk if you don't receive the business loan? Will your company fail without the business loan?</li>
				<li>In what state is your business currently? Growing, stable, failing? Businesses that are not fairing as well will not have as good funding terms or business loan options.</li>
				<li>How capable is your leading management? Without a key focus on what you are planning to do with the money can lead to ultimatelynot obtaining a business loan. Loaners are very keen on knowing what is going to be done with the money, and your business’s plan on repaying the business loan.</li>
			</ul>
